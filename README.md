#### Description:  Web/mobile application to grow engagement across dynamic online communities
Skypeers is a platform for engaging dynamic communities of interest.  It capitalizes on the rapid adoption of cloud services, as well as the heightened expectations of users to create more personalized experiences across more focused communities.
